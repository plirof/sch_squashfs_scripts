# This is hard coded to download from a server running in 192.168.1.200 
This runs at startup this :
```bash
cd /tmp
wget http://192.168.1.200/uploads/john_downloads.sh
chmod a+x john_downloads.sh
. john_downloads.sh

```
So, the file http://192.168.1.200/uploads/john_downloads.sh MUST exists

If different you must change it
