Set Ubuntu's system clock to use localtime, not UTC




Need your Ubuntu clock to stay in sync with a dual-boot Windows install? It seems to have changed over the years, and google wasn't finding any pages for me offering suggestions that still worked.

Turns out, in Ubuntu Oneiric Ocelot, it's controlled by the file /etc/default/rcS: set UTC=no.

Apparently it's also possible to get Windows to understand a UTC system clock using a registry tweak.

Ironically, that page, which I found by searching for windows system clock utc, also has the answer for setting Ubuntu to local time. So if I'd searched for Windows in the first place, I wouldn't have had to puzzle out the Ubuntu solution myself. Go figure!
